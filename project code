I have started my journey and tried my best to be consistent. I know there's a long way.<br>
I want to share my experience in these days and the struggles i faced during this period <br>
and what helped me in my learning process.

<h1 style='color:red'>Struggles I faced while I learn a new language:</h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<h1 style='color:red'>Fear of learning a new language:</h1><br>
Whenever a person chooses to learn a new language, he has to leave his comfort zone . This involves carefully scrutinizing the language to learn as well as to accept that these differences make the languages unique and distinct from each other.

This acceptance will remove any hesitation a person may have about the new language, as well as prepare him mentally to embark on the journey to speak a new language.

Although it sounds easier than it seems, many people fear the new change because they are unsure about the new language’s features.Prepare yourself mentally and start searching for opportunities that would take you to the new language.
<br>
<h1 style='color:red'> Priority  </h1>
In the present times,everyone's a having a busy schedule and some are paid by the time they are involved in the work. In these situatuions most of us would prioritize our work and want to increase the efficiency of our eork . whe considering<br>

our main stream bussiness or job its possible that you have no time left to allot for the new language. This happened to me too. i would suggest you to take this challenge for only ten minutes a day or like a break rather than thinking that you <br>

have to learn this for some other reason.have fun with the vocabulary.Taking out a little time from the everyday routine to learn the words of the new language is sure to benefit a person more in the long run. Keeping in consideration the age of technology and the internet, squeezing out time while on the go is even easier these days.

<h1 style='color:red'>Sources</h1>
When you learn a language, you shouldn’t get too many resources but you shouldn’t have too many either.
For widely-learned languages there’s an infinite pool of resources. Trying to get the best of them will only slow you down. The best resource is the one you actually use.
I thought of taking a look at as many youtubes channels i can and to sarch in google for the resources. You don’t need many resources. You need resources you use.
This being said, some lesser-learned languages can offer quite the challenge to find resources.Finding movies with subtitles is impossible and there are barely any videos with subtitles available online.
 it’s better to use what you have available in original ways. Create your own lessons. you can also try Asking questions on language-exchange platforms like HelloTalk.
Get a few resources and period.
<h1 style='color:red'>Hesitation</h1>

Okay this has to be a straight point. Remember "You are a <b>Beginner</b>"and you have started yoour jourey quite recently i have experienced this when i wnated to practice and experiment on new words and different synonyms 
but i was unable to .reason ?? i cared about the opnoins of others mainly the strangers whom i didnt even know .This point is similar to overcoming the fear of learning a new language. Many of the people have that hesitation so ingrained in them that they are afraid to let their old ways go. This may be because they are so used to their old ways that getting out of their comfort zone is difficult for them. These old ways may also refer to the way a person’s native language is. For example, the writing script of English is different from that of Arabic and Urdu. Some languages, such as Chinese are written from top to bottom.

Some languages have different sentence structures, while other languages have gender aspects to inanimate objects. Accepting the differences between languages is the key to learning a new language. Rather than resisting the change, just accept the differences and kick-start the journey to learning a new language.
<h1 style='color:red'>Not being consistent</h1>
Learning a language is an ultra-marathon. It’s not about who’s going fastest, it’s about who’ll last the longest. The more time you spend learning a language, the better you’ll speak the language. It’s that simple.
Staying consistent when you already have a busy life isn’t easy though. When you’re not living abroad, you don’t have to learn the language. It’s something you have to add to your life, which means you also have to give up something else.
“Choice means giving up something you want for something else you want more.” — Dan Millman
To stay consistent you have to know why you’re learning the language. If you’re making your first foreign language nothing more than a challenge, you’ll likely give up. Only those who’ve learned to love language learning can sustain their journey on such a small goal.
Why are you learning this language? Is it to talk to relatives? To read books? To exchange with business partners? To chat with native speakers? For a trip? For living abroad? What will you use this language for?
If you know the answer to these questions and reflect on them regularly, you can find time in your already busy life.

<h1 style='color:red'>What helped me!</h1>
<h1 style='color:red'>Make new conncections</h1>
YES,you heared me right!.
If there’s a community of people who speak the language you want to learn in your city, start attending events! Friendship is one of the best ways to learn a foreign language, and the easiest way to get comfortable with the slang, intonation, and mannerisms. You can casually chat with your friends in local cafés, bars, and restaurants and slowly build a foundation on the language you want to learn. The great part about making friends who already speak the language (or are learning right along with you) is that you will be able to practice freely without feeling self-conscious or on the spot!

<h1 style='color:red'>Use multimedia</h1>

For the people who want to take advantage of one of the best ways to learn a language from the comfort of their own home, put on a foreign movie in another language — without subtitles if you can! Not only is this one of the best ways to learn a foreign language, but you will also get a greater sense of that language’s culture as well! If you don’t know enough of the language to turn the subtitles off, keep a list of new vocabulary words you hear and what you think they mean. Look them up later. Come on, looking up words is fun! (sidenote: If you feel ready and want to “level up” your language learning, commit to going out to a theater and watching a foreign flick in public!)

<h1 style='color:red'>Use online rsources</h1>
The internet is a truly magical place. If you’re looking for the best ways to learn a foreign language, look no further! You can fall back on ol' reliable Google Translate, but why not utilize helpful browser extensions like Toucan?

What else can you do to learn a language online? You can connect with other language learners via online chat groups, watch YouTube videos, and read articles. The internet is ready to help you reach your foreign language learning goals!
<h1 style='color:red'>Teach yourself, practice</h1>

The key to this one is small steps of dedicated research – and while obvious, remains one of the best ways to learn a new language. Take a little bit of time every day to write out a sentence you would like to know how to say in your target language. Look up each word/section and try to construct the sentence yourself. If you have a language partner, have them double check your sentences when you meet up. This is a great trick to keep yourself in check. Making small goals to attain every day will keep you moving onward and upward on the language learning track!
